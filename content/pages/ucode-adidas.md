First hackathon held at the School of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Zaragoza, aimed at students at the national level offered by Adidas.

The challenges were offered by different companies and aimed at using artificial intelligence in different environments. We focused on the challenge offered by Adidas itself to identify shoes, in the way and with the purpose that each one wanted.

Access was offered to the Institute of Biocomputation and Complex Systems Physics (BIFI), so that the Cloud infrastructure of the Aragon Supercomputing Center (CESAR) could be used.

In addition to identifying the shoes based on an image, we made an api that scanned twitter to search in real time, all the hashtag of the scanned shoes.
