First great hackathon in which I participate with a pre-established team, in this case offered by [NASA](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/){target="_blank"}. 

We wanted to make our own project, so we made an android application that helped to identify the recyclable objects showing at the same time how much material and carbon emissions are saved in relation to the type of object to be recycled.

At the same time it shows the container in which to recycle it, so that even small children can use the application, and compete with their friends to get better scores.

All this is done by artificial intelligence, so that it was learning and becoming smarter every time you scanned an object.

A great starting point is TensorFlow, with asynchronous tasks using celery and redis for self-learning.
